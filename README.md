# Defcon 26 Badge info (from a totes n00b)

## About the badge
    * the silver defcon logo on the bottom left of the badge is a `d-pad`
    * the two silver circles on the bottom right of the badge are `+/-` buttons

## Connecting to the badge
* plug micro USB into computer
* look for device in `/dev/`
    * look for a `/dev/tty*` file that looks fishy (ex: `/dev/tty.usbmodemFD121`)
* screen into it (ex `screen /dev/tty.usbmodemFD121`)
    * when you do this you'll see a maze that you can control with the defcon logo in the bottom right (it's a `d-pad` ðŸ˜º)
* to disconnect run  (`ctrl + a`) then release and hit `d`
    * NOTE: when you do this, if you run `screen /dev/tty.usbmodemFD121` you'll get the following error `Sorry, could not find a PTY.`
        * to fix just unplug your badge and plug it a back in then run `screen /dev/tty.usbmodemFD121` again and you should see the maze \o/

## The maze
    * the blinking cursor in the maze is controlled by the `d-pad` on the badge

You're in an arcade room screaming of the 80s. Good games, good times!
A poster says "0x2BFC8E2B3561C04FBBC73FA43D5D96540D0AA008B30924CE47DA0EC67530D3"

        ```
    * testing:
        * I think this might be a hex dealio, so I did some stuffs in node based on what the googles told me to do to parse
